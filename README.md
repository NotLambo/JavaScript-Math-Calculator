# JavaScript-Math-Calculator
A simple JavaScript calculator containing Addition, Multiplication, Division, Remainder Division, Percentage Of Calculations. It does not have a User Interface though as its just made through prompts and window.alerts - Sorry I am new to JavaScript and just learned about functions so I wanted to practice. Thanks for viewing.
